Busy weekend. didnt get to achieve as much as i wanted

Question regarding Api <3

Currently /movies returns

    {
        "id": 862,
        "title": "Toy Story",
        "release_date": "1995-10-30",
        "vote_average": 7.7,
        "popularity": 21.946943,
        "actor_name1": "Tom Hanks",
        "actor_name2": "Tim Allen"
    },

Api specification States /movies should return 

    {
        "id": 58,
        "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest",
        "vote_average": 7,
        "popularity": 29.455314,
    },

Is the API Finalised? aka, Do you wish for the "release_date" Key to be removed to meet the specification?
